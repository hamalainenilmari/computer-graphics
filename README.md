# Computer Graphics

This course provided comprehensive coverage of fundamental computer graphics concepts through six progressive programming assignments.

## Assignment 1: Introduction

This assignment focused on foundational graphics programming tasks. It included implementing keyboard-controlled object translation (R1), generating a 3D cone model with correct geometry and flat shading (R2), converting indexed mesh data to a GPU-friendly vertex array format (R3), and parsing 3D models from OBJ files to display complex meshes (R4)

## Assignment 2: Splines and Subdivision

This assignment focused on implementing spline curves and mesh subdivision algorithms as fundamental building blocks for animation and 3D modeling. It included evaluating BÃ©zier curves using control points and parametric evaluation (R1), implementing B-spline curve evaluation for smooth interpolation (R2), and developing a complete Loop subdivision system for triangle meshes consisting of subdividing meshes into smaller triangles (R3a), computing positions for newly created vertices using weighted averaging (R3b), and smoothing the mesh by repositioning existing vertices based on their neighborhoods (R3c).

## Assignment 3: Hierarchical Modeling and Animation

This assignment focused on hierarchical character modeling and skeletal animation systems. It included implementing hierarchical traversal with joint-to-world transformations (R1), creating interactive joint rotation controls (R2), visualizing joint coordinate systems for debugging (R3), implementing skeletal subspace deformation to bind skin meshes to the skeleton (R4), and extending the skinning system to properly transform vertex normals (R5).

## Assignment 4: Physical Simulation

This assignment focused on building physical simulation systems for animating natural phenomena. It included implementing an Euler integrator for basic numerical integration (R1), creating a spring system to simulate spring-mass interactions (R2), developing a more stable trapezoid integrator for improved accuracy (R3), building a pendulum system to demonstrate complex oscillatory motion (R4), and constructing a cloth simulation using a large network of particles connected by springs (R5).

## Assignment 5: Ray Tracing

This assignment focused on implementing a basic ray tracer. It included displaying image coordinates for debugging (R0), generating rays with ambient lighting support (R1), visualizing depth information (R2), implementing perspective camera projection (R3), creating Phong shading with directional and point lights (R4), adding plane intersection calculations (R5), implementing triangle intersection for complex meshes (R6), generating realistic shadows through shadow rays (R7), creating mirror reflections using recursive ray tracing (R8), and implementing antialiasing for improved image quality (R9)

## Assignment 6: Real-Time Shading

This assignment focused on implementing real-time shading for a detailed human head model using OpenGL shaders. It included sampling diffuse and normal textures to enhance surface detail (R1), implementing Lambertian diffuse shading for basic surface lighting (R2), calculating the GGX distribution function D for microfacet-based specular highlights (R3), implementing the GGX masking-shadowing function G for realistic light occlusion (R4), and computing the Fresnel reflectivity coefficient Fr for accurate surface reflection behavior (R5).
